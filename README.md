# Cogy

Cogy provides a way to integrate Cog with Rails apps, in a way that managing
and adding commands is a breeze.


## Why

Creating a command that talks with a Rails app, typically involves writing
a route, maybe a controller, an action and code to handle the command arguments
and options.

This is a repetitive task and Cogy provides a way to get rid of this tedious
boilerplate code.
